...10 months later.  Time certainly flies when you're in a pandemic with small children and attending an online, part-time, coding bootcamp.  It's hard to believe that my Flatiron journey is almost over and even crazier to think about all the things I have learned over this past year. From Ruby to Rails; from JavaScript to Redux...I feel equipped with some powerful tools to begin my professional Software Engineering journey. 

However, it's not the specific languages, tools, or frameworks that are the largest take-away from my Flatiron Journey.  Instead, it is the skill of Learning Code that I find to be the greatest achievement.

I remember being a little hesitant about learning a brand new skill-and learning it online, nonetheless.  Would I be able to keep up and learn what I need to learn without the benefits and comfort of a classroom setting?  Would the online resources be enough?  Who would I reach out to if I truly got stuck?  Is coding even the right fit for me?  But now that all is said and done, I believe that the combination of Flatiron's curriculum AND the fact that I did it completely online created a perfect environment to develop the necessary skill of Learning Code.

It seems as though Learning Code is something that will ALWAYS be a part of a developer's career.  There is always a new technology out there with new and improved ways of handling data, improving a user's experience, or keeping sensitive information secure.  The tools in my toolbox right now will most likely be outdated 5 years from now and the only way to stay relevant is to constantly be Learning Code.

As much as this can be frustrating or overwhelming to think about sometimes, I also find that constantly learning new and improved ways of doing things is incredibly exciting.  I think it might be my most favorite thing about Software development.
