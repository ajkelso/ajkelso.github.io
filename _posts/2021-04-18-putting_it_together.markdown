Here we are...10 months later.  Time certainly flies when you're in a pandemic with small children and attending an online, part-time, coding bootcamp.  It's hard to believe that my Flatiron journey is almost over and even crazier to think about all the things I have learned over this past year. From Ruby to Rails; from JavaScript to Redux...I feel equipped with some very powerful tools to begin my professional Software Engineering journey. 

However, it's not the specific languages, tools, or frameworks that are the largest take-aways from my Flatiron Journey.  Instead, it is the skill of Learning Code that I find to be the greatest achievement.

I remember being a little hesitant about learning a brand new skill-and learning it online, nonetheless.  Would I be able to keep up and learn what I needed to without the benefits and comfort of a classroom setting?  Would the online resources be enough?  Who would I reach out to if I truly got stuck?  Is coding even the right fit for me?  When the course first started, some of these questions still remained.  It was tough to dive into a brand new field of study and in such a foreign way.  But now that all is said and done, I believe that the combination of Flatiron's curriculum AND the fact that I did it completely online created a perfect environment to develop the necessary skill of Learning Code. 

It seems as though Learning Code is something that will ALWAYS be a part of a developer's career.  There is always a new technology out there with new and improved ways of handling data, improving a user's experience, or keeping sensitive information secure.  The tools in my toolbox right now will most likely be outdated 5-10 years from now and the only way to stay relevant is to constantly be Learning Code.

And as much as this can be frustrating or overwhelming to think about sometimes, I also find that constantly learning new and improved ways of doing things is incredibly exciting.  I think it might be my most favorite thing about Software development.  The fact that the work will always be changing, evolving, and improving is comforting, in a way, and is helpful to remember when being confronted with waves of ‘imposter syndrome’.  Although I know that what I’ve learned is just the tip of the iceberg, the fact that every software engineer is also constantly learning and improving their ‘toolbox’ can make me feel included and part of some sort of ‘club’.

As my Flatiron journey comes to an end, it’s somewhat scary to be venturing out into the ‘real world’ of software engineering where real clients/bosses/colleagues will have real problems/demands/expectations.  It will be full of ups and downs; frustrations and victories.  But learning how to Learn Code has made me feel prepared and ready to accept the challenge.  I feel confident not knowing the answer to every question or the solution to every problem right off the bat because I know that I have learned what it takes to bridge that gap. So, bring it on!
